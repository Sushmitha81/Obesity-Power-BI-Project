# Obesity Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a simple and interactive Power BI dashboard to explore the causes of obesity.

## Problem
Obesity is a big health problem worldwide, leading to serious illnesses and lowering the quality of life.

## Data
The data used includes information about:
- **Age** and **Gender**.
- **Height**, **Weight**, and **BMI**.

- **Physical Activity**: How often people exercise.

## Method
**Data Preparation**:
- Clean the dataset to handle missing, inconsistent, or outlier data points.
- Normalize or categorize variables such as diet types or exercise frequency.
- Transform raw data into meaningful categories for analysis.


## Results
- Identify the most significant causes of obesity based on diet (e.g., high-calorie consumption, fast food) and lack of physical activity.
- Discover how age and gender correlate with obesity patterns.

## Tools
- **Power BI**: To build the dashboard and visualizations.
- **Python**: To clean and analyze the data.

## Conclusion
The project aims to create an insightful obesity analysis dashboard that highlights the main contributors to obesity. By simplifying complex data, the dashboard can help health professionals and individuals better understand obesity causes, potentially guiding healthier choices.
